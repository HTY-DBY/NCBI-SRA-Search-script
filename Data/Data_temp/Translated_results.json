After staying at room temperature for 4 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 12000 rpm to obtain the aqueous phase that was mixed with absolute ethyl alcohol. RD solution was used to remove residual protein impurity in RNA samples and the purified total RNA was stored at RNase-free tubes after repeated centrifugation. When RNA integrity number > 7.0 and A260/280 > 1.8, messenger RNA (mRNA) with poly A was caught using oligo(dT) dynabeads (25-61005, THERMO FISHER, USA) and then broken into fragmentation with the specific kit (E6150S, NEBNEST, USA). Double-strands complementary DNA was synthesized based on the reverse transcriptase and E. coli DNA polymerase I that were provided by LIANCHUAN BIO TECHNOLOGIES Co., LTD (Hangzhou, China). Paired-ends of the complementary DNA were added with a “A” base, which could combine with the adapter sequence. After the second strand was digested, the sequencing library (300±50 bp) was established by amplifying the target sequences.",

The ground stem powder was collected into a precooled 2 mL Eppendorf tube with 2 mL RNase-free cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extracting solution, which contained 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), 2.5% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The tubes were then placed in a water bath at 65 °C for 30 min to induce cell lysis, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 25-28 °C. The residue was discarded, and the supernatant solution was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Trichloromethane (1 mL) was added to the supernatant solution, blended lightly, and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube, and this procedure was repeated once more. Subsequently, 8 M lithium chloride was added with RNase-free water to 0.6 volume of the supernatant and left overnight.

Finally, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free ddH2O and stored at -80 °C until further use. Poly (A) mRNA from the total RNA was enriched by poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified mRNA was then divided into short fragments by mixing with fragmentation buffer. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer primer. The buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were then added to the fragmented mRNA templates to synthesize the second-strand cDNA. The double-stranded cDNA was purified using magnetic beads. End repair and the addition of 3′-end single nucleotide A (adenine) were then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments, which were enriched by PCR amplification. During the quality control step, a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) were used to qualify and quantify sequences for the sample libraries.

The powder was collected into a precooled 2 mL Eppendorf tube with 2 mL RNase-free cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extracting solution, which contained 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), 2.5% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The tubes were then placed in a water bath at 65 °C for 30 min to induce cell lysis, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 25-28 °C. The residue was discarded, and the supernatant solution was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Trichloromethane (1 mL) was added to the supernatant solution, blended lightly, and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube, and this procedure was repeated once more. Subsequently, 8 M lithium chloride was added with RNase-free water to 0.6 volume of the supernatant and left overnight. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 13 000 rpm and 4 °C to obtain the RNA precipitate. RNase-free ethyl alcohol (75%) was used to wash the RNA precipitate twice. Finally, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free ddH2O and stored at -80 °C until further use. Poly (A) mRNA from the total RNA was enriched by poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified mRNA was then divided into short fragments by mixing with fragmentation buffer. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer primer. The buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were then added to the fragmented mRNA templates to synthesize the second-strand cDNA. The double-stranded cDNA was purified using magnetic beads. End repair and the addition of 3′-end single nucleotide A (adenine) were then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments, which were enriched by PCR amplification. During the quality control step, a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) were used to qualify and quantify sequences for the sample libraries. The constructed library products were prepared for sequencing using a HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).",

The ground stem powder was collected into a precooled 2 mL Eppendorf tube with 2 mL RNase-free cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extracting solution, which contained 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), 2.5% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The tubes were then placed in a water bath at 65 °C for 30 min to induce cell lysis, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 25-28 °C. The residue was discarded, and the supernatant solution was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Trichloromethane (1 mL) was added to the supernatant solution, blended lightly, and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube, and this procedure was repeated once more. Subsequently, 8 M lithium chloride was added with RNase-free water to 0.6 volume of the supernatant and left overnight. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 13 000 rpm and 4 °C to obtain the RNA precipitate. RNase-free ethyl alcohol (75%) was used to wash the RNA precipitate twice. Finally, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free ddH2O and stored at -80 °C until further use. Poly (A) mRNA from the total RNA was enriched by poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified mRNA was then divided into short fragments by mixing with fragmentation buffer. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer primer. The buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were then added to the fragmented mRNA templates to synthesize the second-strand cDNA. The double-stranded cDNA was purified using magnetic beads. End repair and the addition of 3′-end single nucleotide A (adenine) were then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments, which were enriched by PCR amplification. During the quality control step, a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) were used to qualify and quantify sequences for the sample libraries. The constructed library products were prepared for sequencing using a HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).",

The powder was collected into a precooled 2 mL Eppendorf tube with 2 mL RNase-free cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extracting solution, which contained 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), 2.5% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The tubes were then placed in a water bath at 65 °C for 30 min to induce cell lysis, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 25-28 °C. The residue was discarded, and the supernatant solution was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Trichloromethane (1 mL) was added to the supernatant solution, blended lightly, and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube, and this procedure was repeated once more. Subsequently, 8 M lithium chloride was added with RNase-free water to 0.6 volume of the supernatant and left overnight. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 13 000 rpm and 4 °C to obtain the RNA precipitate. RNase-free ethyl alcohol (75%) was used to wash the RNA precipitate twice. Finally, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free ddH2O and stored at -80 °C until further use. Poly (A) mRNA from the total RNA was enriched by poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified mRNA was then divided into short fragments by mixing with fragmentation buffer. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer primer. The buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were then added to the fragmented mRNA templates to synthesize the second-strand cDNA. The double-stranded cDNA was purified using magnetic beads. End repair and the addition of 3′-end single nucleotide A (adenine) were then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments, which were enriched by PCR amplification. During the quality control step, a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) were used to qualify and quantify sequences for the sample libraries. The constructed library products were prepared for sequencing using a HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).",

The ground stem powder was collected into a precooled 2 mL Eppendorf tube with 2 mL RNase-free cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extracting solution, which contained 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), 2.5% CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The tubes were then placed in a water bath at 65 °C for 30 min to induce cell lysis, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 25-28 °C. The residue was discarded, and the supernatant solution was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube. Trichloromethane (1 mL) was added to the supernatant solution, blended lightly, and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into a clean 2 mL Eppendorf tube, and this procedure was repeated once more. Subsequently, 8 M lithium chloride was added with RNase-free water to 0.6 volume of the supernatant and left overnight. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 13 000 rpm and 4 °C to obtain the RNA precipitate. RNase-free ethyl alcohol (75%) was used to wash the RNA precipitate twice. Finally, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free ddH2O and stored at -80 °C until further use. Poly (A) mRNA from the total RNA was enriched by poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified mRNA was then divided into short fragments by mixing with fragmentation buffer. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using a random hexamer primer. The buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I were then added to the fragmented mRNA templates to synthesize the second-strand cDNA. The double-stranded cDNA was purified using magnetic beads. End repair and the addition of 3′-end single nucleotide A (adenine) were then performed. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments, which were enriched by PCR amplification. During the quality control step, a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) were used to qualify and quantify sequences for the sample libraries. The constructed library products were prepared for sequencing using a HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).",

The plates were then shaken using an orbital plate shaker for 10 minutes. The plates were then checked to ensure that the cells were lysed, and if not placed back on the plate shaker for an additional five minutes. Once the cells were lysed, adhesive seals were placed on the plates and the lysates were frozen in the 384-well plates and stored at −80 °C until further processing. The Templated Oligonucleotide Sequencing Assay (TempO-Seq™, BioSpyder Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used as an RNA sequencing technology of choice. Detailed protocols for TempO-seq are provided by the manufacturer and were previously reported detailed elsewhere (Grimm et al., 2016; House et al., 2022). TempO-seq libraries were prepared using the human whole transcriptome panel consisting of 22,537 protein-coding transcripts.",
